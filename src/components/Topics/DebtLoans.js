            <h2>What is a loan?</h2>
            A loan is a sum of money that is borrowed that is expected to be paid back with interest. There are many types of loans, such as car loans, mortgages, student loans, and personal loans. To apply for a loan, you will need to provide the lender with information about your income, assets, and debt. The lender will then use this information to determine whether you are eligible for the loan and what interest rate you will be charged. Before you sign any loan documents, it is important to understand the terms of the loan, including the interest rate, repayment period, and fees. This will help you avoid surprises down the road.
